# Web Scraping Project: E-Book Store Data
### Project Overview
This project involves web scraping data from an online e-book store to extract useful information such as book titles, prices, stock availability, and product links. The data is stored in a structured format using pandas and can be used for further analysis.

## Objective
The main goal of the project is to gather data on:

Book Titles
Prices
Stock Availability
Product Links
The final dataset contains 1,000 rows and 4 columns, providing valuable insights into the store's offerings.

## Tools & Libraries Used
BeautifulSoup: For parsing and extracting data from HTML.
requests: For sending HTTP requests to the website.
pandas: For organizing and managing the scraped data.
Project Workflow
Scraping Data: I scraped 50 pages of the e-book store's catalog to retrieve book details.
Cleaning Data: Prices were cleaned to remove unwanted characters, and stock availability was organized for clarity.
Storing Data: The collected data was saved in a pandas dataframe and exported to a CSV file for easy access and analysis.
## Final Output
The final dataset includes:

Book Titles
Prices
Stock Availability
Product Links
This dataset consists of 1,000 entries, each containing detailed information about the books available in the store.

## Conclusion
This project helped me sharpen my skills in web scraping, data cleaning, and organizing data in a meaningful structure for analysis. The collected data can now be utilized for further analysis, price comparison, or market insights.
